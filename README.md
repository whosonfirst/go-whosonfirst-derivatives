# go-whosonfirst-representation

This is work in progress. It basically the `/api` package extracted from the [whosonfirst/go-whosonfirst-spelunker-httpd](https://github.com/whosonfirst/go-whosonfirst-spelunker-httpd).

It provides a simple HTTP interface for serving different representations of machine-readable formats for Who's On First documents.

The goal, once it's been proven to work, is to import and use this package in `whosonfirst/go-whosonfirst-spelunker-httpd`.
